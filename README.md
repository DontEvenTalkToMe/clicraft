# clicraft
Welcome to cli-craft, DontEvenTalkToMe's Unofficial Minecraft Clone built for a CLI! It is scripted in Bash!

Pre-requisites:
  - awk (aka gawk)

## Installation:

1. Paste this into your terminal,
```sh
git clone https://github.com/DontEvenTalkToMe/clicraft
cd clicraft
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```
2. Type in 'clicraft' in your terminal to get started! Have fun!
Note: The game will only work on Linux and specifically those with the bash shell

All feedback, advice, ideas etc are very, VERY welcome! This is my first proper Github Repo and Bash Script and so I am very inexperienced! I am very sorry to those who know bash and see the absolutely hideous, ineffeicient, over-engineered code I've written!
